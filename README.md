This Arduino sketch utilizes the RemoteXY library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a project using an ESP8266 module. The GUI configuration and connection settings are defined within the code, allowing the user to control five buttons via the RemoteXY mobile app.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and steps to set up and run the project:

Overview
Purpose: This code sets up a wireless control interface using RemoteXY, allowing you to control digital outputs on an ESP8266 using a mobile app.

Requirements
Hardware:

ESP8266 module
Connected components (e.g., LEDs, relays) to the defined digital output pins
Software:

Arduino IDE
RemoteXY library version 3.1.10 or later
RemoteXY mobile app (Android 4.13.11 or later, iOS 1.10.3 or later)
Steps to Set Up
Install RemoteXY Library:

Download and install the RemoteXY library from RemoteXY website.
Configure the ESP8266 Module:

Ensure the ESP8266 is correctly connected and set up to use hard serial communication.
Load the Code:

Copy the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
Set Up the GUI:

The GUI configuration is embedded in the code. This configuration defines the layout and functionality of the interface in the RemoteXY mobile app.
